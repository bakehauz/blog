L﻿ong time ago. I﻿t was so simple. You can even use just regular notepad app.

1﻿5 years is all it takes to evolve from html and css to those things. As a user, you'll never know them probably. You just know that your Instagram and Twitter, and other app you use load faster than a blink of an eye with so much more functionalities.

D﻿amn. Feels like yesterday when I enjoy editing my friendster page with blinking text.
